### Hello World
A very simple bot that greets the user by her name.
The bot asks user about her name if it doesnâ€™t know it yet.

To perform the dialog branching this bot uses [modal contexts](https://docs.zenbot.org/botscript/conversations/).

### How to Use
Just send a request like "Hello" or "Hi there!".
